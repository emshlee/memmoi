## Inspiration
People have a tendency to leave their phones behind and easily forget to complete daily activities—whether it be due to exhibiting early signs of dementia or simple habits of not carrying a phone at all times. Whatever the case may be that hinders the regular use of brain training game applications, we resolved that having the application on a smartwatch simply solves this problem. 

Additionally, based on further research, we discovered that somatosensory games are more applicable for patients in the middle-stage of dementia, enabling the exercise of both the patient’s cognitive and physical ability. 

Accumulating our findings, we designed an always-accessible smartwatch application that helps slow down the progression of dementia by reinforcement learning of patterns and regular simple memorization exercises. The goal of our application is to slow down the progression of dementia by implementing research-backed methods of brain training games that reinforce cognitive repetition and motor functions.
