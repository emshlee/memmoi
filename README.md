## Inspiration
People have a tendency to leave their phones behind and easily forget to complete daily activities—whether it be due to exhibiting early signs of dementia or simple habits of not carrying a phone at all times. Whatever the case may be that hinders the regular use of brain training game applications, we resolved that having the application on a smartwatch simply solves this problem. 

Additionally, based on further research, we discovered that somatosensory games are more applicable for patients in the middle-stage of dementia, enabling the exercise of both the patient’s cognitive and physical ability. 

Accumulating our findings, we designed an always-accessible smartwatch application that helps slow down the progression of dementia by reinforcement learning of patterns and regular simple memorization exercises. The goal of our application is to slow down the progression of dementia by implementing research-backed methods of brain training games that reinforce cognitive repetition and motor functions.

Memmoi provides the seniors with an exercise that could be practiced daily for memory retention, and to stimulate their cognitive functions. It uses a multi-sensory input which first stimulates the user with a set of short-pulsed, rhythmic vibrations. The user is then required to recall the initial rhythmic vibration patterns and repeat the sequence by tapping. Not only does this give motor feedback to what the user remembers, but it also contains a bonus challenge that asks the user to actively recall the sequence and count the number of stimulations. This way, the user could reinforce cognitive repetition and motor functions to allow brain-exercising.
